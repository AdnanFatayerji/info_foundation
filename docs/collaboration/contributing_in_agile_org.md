## as an agile coordinator = owner

A coordinator in an agile organization does not control, has no decision power.

Its the reverse of a power play. A coordinator does not command or take decisions. Decisions happen automatically because an agile process is being followed.

A coordinator

- is at service of the circle or the larger community they work for
- makes sure 
  - that every contributor of the circle will follow the agile principles and is a good contributor
  - that mission/strategy of the circle is known & understood (documentation e.g. wiki is ideal)
  - that the goals are translated in work and this happens by means of [stories](stories.md)
  - that good [stories](stories.md) are created (good quality, done is done, requirements known, a story is not a task)
  - that stakeholders have input on the stories and they can follow progress
  - that story owners (people who own a specific story) can do their duty (keep timing, escalate, comments ...)
- is a teacher/coach
  - can help people to become a better contributor
  - is capable to explain why agile principles work better

No-one can ever become a coordinator if they have not proven to be a good contributor first.

My personal estimate is that less than 1% of existing professionals have the skill to be a good coordinator.

An good agile Coordinator needs to be aware, this means

- good communicator
- can structure work & document strategy, specs, ... (communication skills)
- don't do things out of ego or old frustrations
- understand own shortcomings
- love him/herself and can love others
- respect for everyone and everything (for effort, people, community, ...)
- knows that they have to work on themselves and improve as a human being
- is not afraid to trust people and wants other to be succesful.
- is not afraid of being different and keep on pushing for the values the group believes in
- knows that intuition is real and not only knowledge or experience counts.
- not afraid to be 100% transparent

## as an agile contributor

TODO:*1 is not complete

Practical Requirements

- willing to use the tools the group agreed to work with (agile tools), willing to get fluint with them
- reports daily on work done in the stories, helps to keep stories up to date
- can be 100% open to everyone else
- done = done
- knows what good enough means
- learns: not just technical, but about agile working, about self improvement, ...

My personal estimate is that less than 30% of existing professionals have the skill to be a good agile contributor.

An good agile contributor needs to be aware or willing to become aware, this means

- understand own shortcomings
- love him/herself and can love others

- is not afraid to trust people and wants other to be succesful.
- is not afraid of being different and keep on pushing for the values the group believes in
- knows that intuition is real and not only knowledge or experience counts.
- not afraid to be 100% transparent
- not afraid to ask others for help

## as an individual star.

There are many people who do not want to be a contributor as described above (maybe they don't believe in this way of working?).

This is ofcourse more than fine. 
"Individual stars" can be amazing contributors, maybe not agile as descibed above but still very powerful & impactful.

We believe its best to work with these people in a more loose collaboration way e.g. based on commissions or token bounties, or ...
