## As an agile contributor

We believe in "self healing organizations" where circles (teams organized around topics) collaborate with each other. It's similar to how our own human body works. For instance: lungs provide oxygen to the body but they need red-blood cells to move the oxygen to the rest of the body; the brain can tell us where to drive, but it needs hands and feet to operate the car.

Organizations like this give a lot of independence to their contributors. However, the organizations can only succeed if contributors know what is expected of them, they have gathered what resources are needed to complete a job, and are willing to follow a set of mutually agreed principles to ensure harmonious and effective working together.

## Practical Requirements

People need to be willing to:

- learn agile methodologies (circles, stories...)
    - [circles roles](circles_roles.md)
    - [stories](stories.md)
    - [trello usage](trello_usage.md) & [circle tools](circles_tools.md)
- use the tools the group have agreed to work with (the agile tools) and are willing to get fluent with them
- report daily on the work done in the stories and always help to keep the stories up to date
- not be afraid to be 100% open to everyone about anything
- know what good enough means
- done = done (means quality is good enough)
- learn: not just technical learning, but about agile working, about self improvement ...
- not be afraid to give feedback to others and escalate when required (in a loving way)
- respect the work of others, try to help others improve whenever possible, not replace them. If someone needs to be replaced or reassigned, honest and open communication needs to happen quickly, so colleagues are not left feeling unsure and anxious.

My personal estimate is that less than 30% of existing professionals have the skill to be a good agile contributor.

A good agile contributor is willing to work on self improvement and:

- to understand their own shortcomings
- to love and have respect for themselves and can love and respect others
- to be able to show appreciation and respect for others effort, for people and for our community
- is not afraid to trust people, wants other to be successful and is willing to take action to help them succeed
- is not afraid of being different and will keep on pushing for the values the group believes in
- knows that intuition is real and that it is not just knowledge or experience that counts
- is not afraid to be 100% transparent
- is not afraid to ask others for help
- is a good communicator
- can structure and document work, strategies, specifications, workflows and processes - has great communication skills

## As an agile coordinator = owner

- Coordinators manage circles inside an agile organization.
- Circles can have subcircles which can have other subcircles...
- A circle is a group of people working together around a set of specific topics.
- A coordinator in an agile organization does not control, has no decision power.

It's the reverse of a an authoritative, or autocratic power play. A coordinator does not command or take decisions. Decisions happen automatically because an agile process is being followed. A coordinator makes sure others can easily contribute and they can find all the information they require, they discover and clear road-blocks and make it possible for people to be their best, its about getting the process to work smoothly without being in the way.

A coordinator:

- is at service of the circle or the larger community they work for
- they make sure that
  - every contributor of the circle will follow the agile principles and is a good contributor
  - the mission or strategy of the circle is known & understood - documentation e.g. a wiki is ideal
  - the goals are translated into achieveable work and this happens by means of [stories](stories.md)
  - good [stories](stories.md) are created (good quality, done is done, requirements known, a story is not a task)
  - stakeholders have input on the stories and they can follow progress
  - story owner's (people who own a specific story) can do their duty (keep to time, have the resources they need, know the specific goal of the story, know who and how to escalate to, make use of comments to clearly track progress)
- is a teacher or coach
  - they get alongside people and help them be their best
  - they help people to become a better contributor
  - are able to explain why agile principles work so well within an organization like ours

No-one can ever become a coordinator unless they have proven themselves to be a good contributor first.

My personal estimate is that less than 1% of existing professionals have the skill to be a good coordinator, its not an easy job.

## As an individual star.

There are many people who do not want to be an agile contributor as described above (maybe they don't believe in this way of working? Maybe it is too hard to change habits which have made them very successful across their career?)

This is, of course, more than fine! 
"Individual stars" can be amazing contributors, maybe not agile as described above but still very powerful & impactful.

We believe it's best to work with these people in a more loose collaborative way. For instance, where they are rewarded based on commissions, or token bounties, or other reward mechanisms where their contributions are directly matched to their fiscal or transactional output.
