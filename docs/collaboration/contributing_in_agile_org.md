## as an agile contributor

We believe in "self healing organizations" where circles (teams organized around topics) collaborate with each other. It's similar to how our own human body works (cells, organisms, communication, ...).
These organizations give a lot of independence to their contributors. 

These organizations can only succeed if contributors know what is expected of them and are willing to follow a set of mutually agreed principles.

Practical Requirements

- willing to learn about agile methodologies (circles, stories, ...)
    - [circles roles](circles_roles.md)
    - [stories](stories.md)
    - [trello usage](trello_usage.md) & [circle tools](circles_tools.md)
- willing to use the tools the group agreed to work with (agile tools), willing to get fluent with them
- reports daily on work done in the stories, helps to keep stories up to date
- not afraid to be 100% open to everyone about anything
- knows what good enough means
- done = done (means quality is good enough)
- learns: not just technical, but about agile working, about self improvement, ...
- not afraid to give feedback to others and escallate when required (in a loving way)
- respects work of others, tries to improve whenever possible, not replace, if needed to replace communication needs to happen.

My personal estimate is that less than 30% of existing professionals have the skill to be a good agile contributor.

A good agile contributor is willing to work on self improvement and

- understand own shortcomings
- love him/herself and can love others
- respect for everyone and everything (for effort, people, community, ...)
- is not afraid to trust people and wants other to be successful.
- is not afraid of being different and keep on pushing for the values the group believes in
- knows that intuition is real and not only knowledge or experience counts.
- not afraid to be 100% transparent
- not afraid to ask others for help
- is a good communicator
- can structure work & document strategy, specs, ... (communication skills)

## as an agile coordinator = owner

Coordinators manage circles inside an agile organization.
Circles can have subcircles who can have other subcircles, ...

A circle is a group of people working together around a set of specific topics.

A coordinator in an agile organization does not control, has no decision power.

It's the reverse of a power play. A coordinator does not command or take decisions. Decisions happen automatically because an agile process is being followed. A coordinator is all about making sure others can easily contribute and they can find all information required, its about getting the process to work smoothly without being in the way.

a coordinator:

- is at service of the circle or the larger community they work for
- makes sure 
  - that every contributor of the circle will follow the agile principles and is a good contributor
  - that mission/strategy of the circle is known & understood (documentation e.g. wiki is ideal)
  - that the goals are translated in work and this happens by means of [stories](stories.md)
  - that good [stories](stories.md) are created (good quality, done is done, requirements known, a story is not a task)
  - that stakeholders have input on the stories and they can follow progress
  - that story owner's (people who own a specific story) can do their duty (keep timing, escalate, comments ...)
- is a teacher/coach
  - can help people to become a better contributor
  - is capable to explain why agile principles work better

No-one can ever become a coordinator if they have not proven to be a good contributor first.

My personal estimate is that less than 1% of existing professionals have the skill to be a good coordinator, its not an easy job.

## as an individual star.

There are many people who do not want to be an agile contributor as described above (maybe they don't believe in this way of working?).

This is ofcourse more than fine. 
"Individual stars" can be amazing contributors, maybe not agile as described above but still very powerful & impactful.

We believe it's best to work with these people in a more loose collaboration way e.g. based on commissions or token bounties, or ...
