## ThreeFold Foundation (TF)

The ThreeFold Foundation (“TFF” or “Foundation”) is promoting a new neutral and sustainable
Internet, the ThreeFold Grid (“TF Grid” or “Grid”). In this Grid, your data is stored local to and
controlled by you.

All the ideas and content created for this concept are opensource and stored in this repository.
A group of volunteers and the ThreeFold Foundation maintain these repositories.

Also look at the ThreeFold [website](https://threefoldtoken.com/).
