## ThreeFold Farmer (TF)

Independent ThreeFold Farmers (“TF Farmer” or “Farmer”) generate compute & storage capacity
(internet capacity) that is registered on the TF Grid.

Internet capacity is produced, purchased and allocated locally - similar to the way
electricity and other utilities are distributed today. This allows any digital service or application
provider to host their services and applications in proximity to the end user leading to significantly
greater performance, a lower price point, and better margins. This solution is both much more cost
effective and green.

TF Farmers are all independent of the ThreeFold Foundation.
