## Frequent Asked Questions

Proposed FAQ Questions for ThreeFold from Richard Walker, Bruce Lites, Jennifer Long

### Internet versus Cloud?

**Question:** The precise role Threefold will play in the entire internet system needs more clarification. ThreeFold is often labeled as “the new internet”, but from what we understand it is more specifically a new cloud technology. The “internet” is the system of connections and routers (and more powerful core routers) that direct packets of information to their intended destination.  In addition to the system of routers and local connections, there is a system of high-speed, long-haul data pipelines (“highways”) called the internet “backbone”.  We understand that ISPs host and pay for maintaining the routing and data transfer infrastructure, hence charge their clients for this service.  Does ThreeFold not only provide an alternative to cloud computing, but also provide some routing service?  If not, is that an area where the ThreeFold grid could improve on its efficiency and speed?

**Answer:** You are right - the original term internet is short for inter(connected) net(works).  This is how it all started - independent networks decided to interconnect (for free).  The purpose of interconnecting networks is to make information available to a wide group (both in numbers and in geo locations) of people.  

So information is stored somewhere and people want to that information. So the original term internet was all about interconnecting networks but the actual purpose for doing that was to allow people to access content.  What would the current internet be without any content?  A network is only able to transport transient messages from source to destination - a means of communications.

What we mean with “internet” today is the total construct of a _lot_ of information stored in network accessible locations.  Therefore the ThreeFold Grid will present new _internet_ capacity to the world.

On top of this cloud technology has a specific connauchtation to it as technology capable of running applications centrally.  As we are building a complete decentralised grid of capacity we would like to stay away from calling it cloud not not have that centralised connaughtation.  However (and this might complicate this answer) our decentralised grid _is_ able to run the same applications and all the existing and established cloud providers.

### What is the required connection speed for Farming?

**Question** Will high-speed connections be essential to the ThreeFold nodes, even small individually-owned ones?  That is, is there only a very a limited utility for home-based ThreeFold nodes unless they have a very high connection speed? If so, it is important to quantify their minimum useful connection speed?

**Anser** Yes and No.  (-; The connection speeds can in theory be anything and the further we reach out and go to the edge the lower the available connection speed will be.  We have not yet colelcted any real life data and once more Farmers are up and running we will start to collect and present this data.

A good rule of thumb is that for home based (small) nodes 10Mbps and up is a good starting point and for larger installations 100Mbps and up is good.  Obviously these numbers are available and affordable (!) in Europe, USA, and some areas in Asia but not everywhere.  For other parts of the world we might end up with mouch lower connection speeds or even alternative networking technologies for exmaple (lora)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-range_Wi-Fi] or others.

### What specifically does the ThreeFold blockchain manage?

**Question** Does the ThreeFold blockchain record all operations and data transfers?  If so, can this get out-of-hand rapidly in terms of storage capacity, and eventually slow the process of validating each blockchain?  If not, is it used only to manage the exchange of tokens for capacity (plus in the future to manage Digital Me), or does it manage metadata of all transactions?

### HOW IS REDUNDANCY ACHIEVED?

**Question** How does the distributed data storage achieve redundancy?  

**Question** Is this done somewhat like a RAID system?

### WHAT IS THE REDUNDANCY FACTOR FOR DATA ON THE THREEFOLD NETWORK?

**Question** If stored data is present in multiple nodes for resistance of the grid to local failures, by what factor is the required grid storage greater than the actual data volume stored?

### DO LARGER NODES PERFORM DIFFERENT FUNCTION THAN INDIVIDUAL NODES?

**Question** Do the small “household” nodes perform a different function from the larger configurations?

### IS THERE A SIMPLER WAY TO EXPLAIN THE 30% CAPACITY RULE FOR FARMING INCOME?

**Question** A farm needs to reach 30% capacity before receiving TFTs.  Once this capacity is reached in a single month, will the farmed TFTs from all consecutive prior months where the 30% limit was not reached be awarded? Also, does this rule apply continuously; i.e. that each time the usage falls below 30%, tokens are withheld until th3 30% usage level is achieved again?

### IS THERE A SIMPLE WAY TO QUANTIFY THE 30% CAPACITY THRESHOLD?

**Question** The online definition of ThreeFold compute units and storage units is not easy to comprehend by the non-expert. How difficult is it to achieve 30% capacity usage, particularly for compute units.  Isn’t it a bit difficult to achieve 30% CPU usage on average?

### HOW DOES THE THREEFOLD GRID KNOW TO HOST SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS NEAR ITS USERS?

**Question** Not all applications and data can be hosted locally because of the scale of the data involved.

### HOW SPECIFICALLY IS “PROOF-OF-STAKE” IMPLEMENTED IN THE THREEFOLD GRID?

### WHERE CAN ONE FIND A SET OF DETAILED TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THREEFOLD FARMING HARDWARE?

**Question** There is a lot of interest in small-scale farming, but the hardware requirements do not seem to be written down, particularly for single nodes that are financially possible for many people.  It is very important that capacity become widely available in many locations, so we need understand the constraints for the hardware before promoting the ThreeFold system. This information is also needed if we are to approach manufacturers to produce hardware for future farmers.

### HOW ARE THREEFOLD TOKENS VALUED RELATIVE TO FARMING CAPACITY? There are several aspects to this question:

**Question** If the token value relative to fiat currency “floats” on the open speculative market, then its value can change rapidly by large amounts. The value of capacity in terms of fiat currency will fluctuate correspondingly unless the cost of internet capacity in tokens is also allowed to float.  If not, then if the speculative market for tokens drives the price up, the ThreeFold internet capacity could rapidly become more expensive than that of the current cloud providers. Will internet capacity in tokens be allowed to float?

**Question** The information we have seems to indicate that individual farmers set the price of their own capacity.  Do they set a price in terms of tokens, or in terms of fiat currency?  Either way, how do fluctuations impact the business of the farmers?

**Question** If the token price relative to fiat currency fluctuates rapidly, how do the small-scale farmers in particular regulate the cost of their capacity?  It seems to me that it would be very useful if there were a baseline price for farming capacity that is somehow automatically adjusted by the ThreeFold OS to follow a constant price relative to fiat currency in order to allow farmers to have a “hands-off” management of their own capacity. Then it might be useful to allow farmers to set the price of their capacity in terms of a multiplicative factor times this baseline price.

**Question** How would an application that is intended for a mobile device negotiate prices with the various ThreeFold farmers as it roams around? This situation especially would require some automatic system-wide pricing.  It will be nearly impossible for a provider to negotiate individually with thousands (or eventually millions) of individual farmers.

### HOW WILL WE IMPLEMENT THE THREEFOLD GRID IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES?

**Question** The places where ThreeFold is most needed are under-served regions that typically have minimal access to internet, if they have any access at all.  In these locations it would be necessary to improve the internet infrastructure first (i.e., more and better routers and backbone).  Furthermore, electric power is not reliable in these locations, compounding the problem of establishing a reliable ThreeFold grid there.  Are there ideas on how to surmount these challenges?

### WHERE BEST TO CONCENTRATE OUR INITIAL EFFORTS TO PROMOTE THE THREEFOLD GRID?

**Question** With respect to emerging markets / developing countries, how does it makes sense for ThreeFold to be in the business of lobbying governments or private companies to install the infrastructure needed to make ThreeFold viable? This is an admirable aspiration but in terms of getting traction it seems best to focus initially on locations where the infrastructure works well.


### HOW DO SMALL-SCALE FARMERS COMPETE WITH FARMERS WITH MORE EXTENSIVE CAPACITY?

Since software performance is a function of the applications being run, the hardware requirements of a software application (internet speed, compute performance, storage capacity, security) place demands on the capacity of the ThreeFold grid. How do farmers configure their hardware in order to satisfy what a consumer or business might need. Will small-scale farmers be shut out from clients either because they cannot provide sufficient capacity for the most common applications, or because the larger nearby farmers can run a more profitable service because of their scale of operation?

### HOW ARE AMBASSADORS TO PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF APPLICATIONS TO RUN ON THE THREEFOLD GRID?

The ThreeFold network/solution is described as “computing at the edge”; a low-cost, energy-efficient computing solution offered close to where consumers and businesses are. It is meant to be an alternative to the likes of Amazon Web Services (AWS) where today you can buy a slice of their stack, including certain applications such as their e-commerce engine, plus the inherent security they offer for $x/month. Users of AWS can add their own specific solutions and integrate them within Amazon’s architecture. So with that said, how do consumers or businesses add their applications/solutions on to the ThreeFold network? What applications, if any, is ThreeFold offering? Is there any thought of encouraging companies like Amazon to migrate some of their services to the ThreeFold grid?

### WILL THREEFOLD BE ABLE TO RESTRICT MALICIOUS CONTENT?

In the same way FaceBook and other social media platforms are getting hammered for privacy-related issues, will DiditalMe as implemented on the ThreeFold grid ensure user privacy? Also, what is ThreeFold doing to ensure that the platform cannot be used to promote dangerous, hateful, offensive content? Side note: YouTube has a whole group of people who spend their entire days reviewing content to try to ensure its platform is not used to promote hateful, despicable content. ThreeFold‘s motives may be pure, but the bad guys may think it is a great “under the radar” platform to help them evangelize their point-of-view. Is it better to have a completely hands-off neutral system and accept the fact that there may be some bad players out there using it as a cost of the neutrality?


### IS THERE A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE DISTRIBUTED GRID AND PRICING OF SERVICE BY INDIVIDUAL FARMERS?

If individual farmers do set the price of tokens, will pricing of service by farmers be available for all to see? If I find that tokens are cheaper in eastern Europe compared to California where I live, I may choose to buy capacity from the eastern Europe cooperative.

  - Doesn’t this defeat the object of the distributed grid?
  - And how can I be assured of performance?
  - And how does this model lead to an increase in the value of tokens over time…especially if consumers decide to buy from whomever is offering the cheapest capacity?
 - ARE ATOMIC SWAP EXCHANGES A PROVEN TECHNOLOGY? Atomic swap exchanges sound like a great idea, do they exist yet and are they proven? This article seems to suggest they are still under development with many challenges to be overcome. https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-exchanges-off-chain-atomic-swaps-and-a-brief-look-into-the-future

### WHAT MIGHT BE THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES?

Governments lag behind technology innovation, but is it fair to assume that they will step in to regulate crypto currencies or potentially even decide to do their own? What if the US Government introduces a digital dollar, what might be the likely impact will be on ThreeFold tokens? If that happened why would anyone need tokens if they can simply trade in a digital version of their own fiat currency? Would national digital dollar be a good candidate for a managed ThreeFold system? Could ThreeFold token exchanges be taxed, for example, to provide funds for public services?
