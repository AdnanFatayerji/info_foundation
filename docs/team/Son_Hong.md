- [Five Languages of Love](http://www.5lovelanguages.com/) Results: Quality Time (9), Acts of Service (8), Words of Affirmation (6), Physical Touch (5), Receiving Gifts (2). 
- I generally have a frosty demeanor (aka "resting bitch face"). It doesn't mean I'm not happy, mad, or wish you ill will. 
- What I'm Working On (written here so you can help me out...don't be afraid to call me out or give me personal feedback)
    - I'm working on being less brutally blunt. Combined with my intensity it can come off as malicious even though it never is.
    - I'm working on practicing [Nonviolent Communication](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test). I grew up in a super-charged, austere, and verbally aggressive family. It's taken me years to peel a good layer of it away. I still have many more years of conscious practice to get where I'd like.
    - I'm learning more about [Stoicism](https://dailystoic.com/) and working to be more stoic. 
    - Work...in...progress...Will + more.
