A Farming Pool is linked to a Farmer, the Farmer receives tokens for providing the IT Capacity.

## Resource Units (RU)

## Resource Bundle (always per TF Node) (Bundle)

- is x number of resource units bundled
- a Resource Bundle is always per TF Node
- e.g. resource bundel type A = 1 cpu unit + 2 mem unit + 3 hd unit + 1 ssd unit
- the resource bundles are defined by the Farmers, its basically a unit of capacity sold. Users cannot buy individual Resource Units, Users buy Resource Bundles by transfering TFT.
